# everypage

everypage is a website creator built with react. With everypage's **declarative** system, users write in JSON, focussing on their content, and get a gorgeous website built with exceptional SEO and performance.

This powers the everypage product (see https://www.everypagehq.com), but is open source to allow customers to never be "tied in" to paying.
